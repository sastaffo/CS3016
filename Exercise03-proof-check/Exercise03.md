# Exercise Three

## Instructions

1. Install `prfchk` as described in `README.md`.
2. Edit file `data/ListProduct.thr` to complete the proofs of the two theorems present, namely `prods_mul_base` and `prods_mul_ind`.
3. A theorem is correct when no line beginning with `!!` is produced when it is checked.

## Advice

Look at theories `Length3` and `LengthsAdd` (in `data`) for examples of proofs that checkout.

## Grading

Total points available: 20

Each `OK` found in a batch check of `ListProduct` results in 2 marks.

Each `!!` found in a batch check of `ListProduct` results will subtract 1 mark.

### Bonus

The marks obtained for Exercise Three will also be added into the marks for Exercises Zero through Two, to bring that total up towards the maximum of 260 points.
